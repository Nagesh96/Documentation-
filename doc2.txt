Design Documentation: Jira to Cherwell Integration1. Introduction1.1 PurposeThe purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the design and implementation details for the integration between Jira and Cherwell using a Python script.1.2 ScopeThis integration aims to synchronize specific fields (e.g., description, environment, priority, custom fields) from a Jira issue to a corresponding Cherwell business object of a defined type (e.g., "New Release").2. Prerequisites2.1 Jira SetupFunctional Jira instance.Jira server URL, username, and password.Identification of the target Jira issue key.2.2 Cherwell SetupAccess to a Cherwell instance.Cherwell base URI, API key, username, and password.Determination of the Cherwell object type for synchronization (e.g., "New Release").2.3 Python LibrariesInstallation of required Python libraries:pip install jira CherwellAPI3. Workflow OverviewThe integration follows a three-step workflow:Jira Field Fetching:Connect to Jira using provided credentials.Fetch desired fields from a specified Jira issue.Cherwell Integration:Utilize CherwellAPI library to connect to Cherwell.Create a new Cherwell business object instance based on the identified object type.Update Cherwell object fields with values fetched from Jira.Business Object ID Printing:After Cherwell update, print the business object record ID to confirm success.4. Implementation Details4.1 Jira Field FetchingUtilize the jira library to establish a connection to Jira.Use Jira REST API to fetch fields from a specified issue.4.2 Cherwell IntegrationUse the CherwellAPI library to establish a connection to Cherwell.Create a new Cherwell business object instance based on the identified object type.Update Cherwell object fields with values fetched from Jira.4.3 Business Object ID PrintingPrint the business object record ID after Cherwell update to confirm successful integration.ï¿¼Enter
