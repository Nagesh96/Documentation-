Integration Design Documentation
1. Prerequisites
-------------------
1.1 Cherwell Prerequisites:
  - Cherwell API Access
  - Cherwell API Key (if applicable)
  - Cherwell Username and Password
1.2 Jira Prerequisites:
  - Jira API Access
  - Jira URL
  - Jira Username and Password
  - Jira Issue Key(s) to be Integrated

2. Workflow,
--------------
2.1 Overview:
The integration will fetch data from Jira issues and create corresponding releases in Cherwell.

2.2 Workflow Steps:
Step 1: Fetch Data from Jira
  - Utilize the Jira API to retrieve relevant information from Jira issues.
  - Map Jira fields to corresponding Cherwell fields (e.g., RequestGroup, ReleaseType, Build, Urgency).
Step 2: Create Release in Cherwell
  - Use the Cherwell API to create a new instance of the Release business object.
  - Set the properties of the new Release based on the fetched data from Jira.
Step 3: Save Release in Cherwell
  - Attempt to save the newly created Release in Cherwell.
  - If successful, retrieve and print the Release ID.

3. Implementation
---------------------
3.1 Cherwell Script:
  - Use the Cherwell API to establish a connection.
  - Create a new instance of the Release business object.
  - Define properties for the new Release (e.g., ShortDescription, Requestor, etc.).
  - Set the properties of the new Release based on the fetched data from Jira.
  - Attempt to save the new Release and print the ID.
3.2 Jira Script (get_data_from_jira function):
  - Use the jira library to connect to Jira.
  - Fetch information from Jira issues using the provided Jira API.
  - Map Jira fields to a dictionary (e.g., {'RequestGroup': ..., 'ReleaseType': ..., 'Build': ..., 'Urgency': ...}).
  - Return the dictionary containing Jira data.

4. Sample Code
---------------
4.1 Cherwell Script:
  - See the previously provided script with the integration logic.
4.2 Jira Script (get_data_from_jira function):
  - See the previously provided function with jira library usage.

5. Testing
------------
5.1 Test Cases:
  - Validate that data is successfully fetched from Jira.
  - Verify that Cherwell Release is created with the correct information.
  - Check for error handling in case of issues during integration.
5.2 Test Environment:
  - Use a test Cherwell instance and a test Jira project for initial testing.
  - Ensure that both Cherwell and Jira test environments are accessible.

6. Troubleshooting
---------------------
6.1 Error Handling:
  - Implement proper error handling in the scripts.
  - Log errors and provide meaningful error messages.
6.2 Debugging:
  - Include debug statements for easier troubleshooting.
  - Utilize logging mechanisms to capture script execution details.
Conclusion
-----------
This design documentation outlines the prerequisites, workflow, implementation details, and testing approach for integrating Jira with Cherwell. Please customize the details based on your specific requirements and environment.
